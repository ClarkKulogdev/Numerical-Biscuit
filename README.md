# Numerical Biscuit

A simple snack for 5 root finding methods


## Instructions
 
   ### Tabs
  * Fixed Iteration Method
   * Bisection Method
   * False Point Method
   * Newton Raphson Method
   * Secant Method
   * About


1. Choose a method.
2. Enter the inputs
     * Equation example x^2-x-1 is ```(x**2)-x-1```(Variable should be separated by the constant by *, for exponent "**" and just put parenthesis for easy read.
     * Ea or Error is greater than 0 but less than 1
     * Iteration must be an positive integer (of course).
     * Initial guess for x, a and b are integer or float.
     * Errors input appear if there is an invalid input.
     * 'x' is the only valid variable.
3. Click Solve

# Application Features
 * If it found a root, it displays a message and the iteration will stop. So if you input 10 iterations but it finds its roots at 7 then it stop. But if it still continue, ehem... That's also a feature.
 * If it didn't found a root, an error will be displayed.
 * If you click Solve but nothing happens in Bisection, False Point and Secant. It means that f(a)*(fb) > 0 so choose another a and b.
